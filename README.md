# DATPacker

Builds and manages Lego Dimensions archives.

# Introduction

I've had a wanting to mod Lego Dimensions for a while now, but it has one major problem... It was only ever released for consoles.

Modding PC games is easy as the executables can be easily modified and the files can be drag-and-dropped for most games; Consoles - not so much.

Lego Dimensions can't be run extracted, which is what most modding of Lego games does. This means that the executable will have to be modified (again not easy) or the custom archives need to be created from scratch - This is where DATPacker comes in.

DATPacker extracts the existing Lego Dimensions archives into one big folder, but remembers which files came from which archive. When it comes to rebuilding it, DATPacker puts the right files into the right archives, and fills in the gaps. This "overwatch" procedure means that files don't need to be separated based on the archive they come from (which is necessary as certain game files need to go into certain folders) but will hopefully help any new modders get started.

# Instructions

Initial setup can be quite technical, so individual guides are written up here:
